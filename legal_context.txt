CHAPTER 1: LEASE (RENTAL)

Article 1: Nature of a Lease
A lease is a right granted for consideration (the “rent”) to possess an asset and use it on a non-permanent basis.

Article 2: Scope of Application
(a) This Chapter applies to the lease of immovable property (real estate) and movable property, and—with the necessary adaptations—also to the lease of rights.
(b) This Chapter applies—with the necessary adaptations—also to subleases; for this purpose, the principal tenant is regarded as the landlord and the subtenant as the tenant.
(c) This Chapter applies where no other law contains special provisions for the matter in question and where no different intention can be inferred from the parties’ agreement.

Article 3: Matters Not Set in the Agreement
Terms of a lease contract that were not agreed between the parties shall be determined according to the custom that the parties regarded as applicable based on prior transactions between them; if there is no such custom, then according to the custom that reasonable parties regard as applicable in transactions of the same type.

Article 4: Good Faith
An obligation arising from a lease contract must be performed in an accepted manner and in good faith; the same applies to the exercise of a right arising from the contract.

CHAPTER 1, SECTION B: LANDLORD’S OBLIGATIONS

Article 5: Delivery—Time and Place
(a) The landlord must deliver the leased asset to the tenant by placing it at the tenant’s disposal.
(b) If delivery within a specified period was agreed, the landlord may set the delivery date within that period. If no delivery date was agreed, delivery shall be within a reasonable time after the contract is formed. In these cases, the landlord must notify the tenant a reasonable time in advance of the delivery date.
(c) Delivery shall take place at the location where the leased asset was located at the time the contract was formed.
(d) If it was agreed that the landlord is responsible for transporting the leased asset, the delivery obligation is performed when the carrier delivers the asset to the tenant at the place agreed with the landlord.

Article 6: Conformity of the Leased Asset and Reliance on Non-Conformity
(a) The landlord shall deliver the leased asset in conformity with what was agreed between the landlord and the tenant.
(b) Non-conformity of the leased asset is governed by Section 11 of the Sale Law, 1968, with the necessary adaptations (hereinafter: “non-conformity”), whether the source of the non-conformity is in the asset itself or in its environment.
(c) The tenant is not entitled to rely on non-conformity in any of the following cases:
(1) The tenant knew of the non-conformity when the lease contract was formed;
(2) The tenant did not notify the landlord of the non-conformity within a reasonable time after discovering it or after the tenant should have discovered it, including a reasonable description of the non-conformity; this does not apply if the landlord knew or should have known of the non-conformity;
(3) The tenant did not give the landlord a reasonable opportunity to inspect the leased asset and, insofar as reasonable in the circumstances, a reasonable opportunity to remedy the non-conformity.
(d) Despite subsection (c), if the tenant did not meet one or more of the burdens in items (1)–(3), the tenant may still rely on the non-conformity to the extent that the failure did not prejudice the landlord.

Article 6A: Conformity of Rights in the Leased Asset
(a) The landlord shall provide the tenant with rights to possess and use the leased asset free of any right that conflicts with the tenant’s rights, including a third-party right. If the landlord provided such rights not free of a conflicting right, this shall be deemed non-conformity and the rules applicable to non-conformity shall apply, with the necessary adaptations. However, Article 6(c)(2) (regarding non-conformity in rights where the tenant did not notify within a reasonable time after the tenant should have discovered it) applies only to a lease that requires registration under Article 152 of the Tenant Protection Law [Consolidated Version], 1972.
(b) The landlord shall prevent the existence of conflicting rights as stated in subsection (a) throughout the entire lease period.

Article 7: Duty to Repair the Leased Asset
(a) The landlord must, within a reasonable time after receiving a request from the tenant, repair in the leased asset—or in the landlord’s property serving the leased asset—anything that causes substantial interference with the ordinary use of the leased asset or with use as agreed between the landlord and the tenant (hereinafter: a “defect”), whether the defect existed at the time of delivery or arose later, except for:
(1) a defect for which the tenant is responsible under the Guardians Law, 1967; or
(2) a defect whose repair, under the agreement or customary practice in the circumstances, is not the landlord’s responsibility.
(b) If the leased asset or the property serving it is movable property, the landlord may perform the duty under this Article by replacing the asset with another asset, provided this is reasonable in the circumstances.
(c) If the leased asset or the property serving it is movable property and repairing the defect would involve an unreasonable disturbance to its use, the tenant is entitled to demand replacement instead of repair.
(d) The costs of replacement under subsections (b) and (c) are borne by the landlord.
(e) This Article does not apply to property leased under a “lease in perpetuity” (long-term leasehold) as defined in Article 3 of the Land Law, 1969.

Article 8: Disclaimer or Limitation of Liability for Non-Conformity or Defect
A clause in a lease contract that exempts the landlord from liability for non-conformity or a defect, or limits such liability, is void if the landlord knew or should have known of the non-conformity or defect at the time the contract was formed or at the time of delivery and did not inform the tenant.

Article 9: Remedies for Failure to Repair a Defect or Non-Conformity
(a) If the tenant demanded that the landlord repair the defect or non-conformity and the landlord did not repair it within a reasonable time from receiving the demand, the tenant may:
(1) repair the defect or non-conformity and demand reimbursement of reasonable expenses from the landlord;
(2) reduce the rent for as long as the defect or non-conformity has not been repaired, in proportion to the decrease in the rental value caused by the defect compared to the value under the contract.
(b) If the tenant wishes to repair the defect or non-conformity, the tenant must notify the landlord a reasonable time in advance.
(c) If the defect or non-conformity is urgent such that the tenant cannot reasonably be required to wait for the landlord to repair it, the tenant may repair it as in subsection (a)(1) without a demand under Article 7(a) or notice under subsection (b).
(d) Despite Article 16A, the tenant may at any time repair a defect whose repair is not the landlord’s responsibility, provided the tenant gave the landlord a reasonable opportunity to repair it.

Article 10: Defect Whose Repair Cannot Be Required
If the defect resulted from circumstances that, at the time the contract was formed, the landlord did not know and should not have known, did not see and should not have been expected to foresee, and could not have prevented—and repairing the defect in those circumstances is impossible or would impose on the landlord an obligation fundamentally different from what the parties agreed—then the defect shall not be grounds for demanding repair, damages, or reimbursement of expenses under Article 9(a)(1).

Article 11: Undisturbed Use
The landlord must enable the tenant to use the leased asset during the lease period, as agreed between the parties, without interference by the landlord or anyone acting on the landlord’s behalf.

CHAPTER 1, SECTION C: TENANT’S OBLIGATIONS

(a) If rent was set as a fixed amount for fixed periods, the tenant shall pay it at the beginning of each period.
(b) Rent shall be paid, by one of the accepted methods, at the landlord’s place of business; if the landlord has no place of business, then at the landlord’s residence.

Article 15: Exemption from Paying Rent
(a) If the leased asset is real estate and the tenant is prevented from using it for the purpose of the lease due to circumstances connected to the leased asset or the access routes to it, and the tenant did not cancel the contract for that reason, the tenant is exempt from paying rent for the period during which use was prevented. After a reasonable time in the circumstances, the landlord may cancel the contract, unless the tenant has notified the landlord beforehand that the tenant waives the exemption from paying rent.
(b) The exemption applies only if, at the time the contract was formed, the tenant did not know and should not have known of the circumstances in subsection (a), did not see and should not have been expected to foresee them, and could not have prevented them.

Article 16: Use of the Leased Asset
The tenant shall not use the leased asset except as agreed; however, if that use was not stipulated as exclusive, the tenant may use the leased asset for another use, provided that it does not harm the leased asset or burden the landlord more than under the agreement.

Article 16A: Alterations to the Leased Asset
(a) The tenant may not make alterations to the leased asset unless the tenant obtained the landlord’s consent.
(b) Despite subsection (a), and subject to the lease contract, a holder of a long-term leasehold (“lease in perpetuity”) as defined in Article 3 of the Land Law is entitled to make alterations to the leased property that do not diminish the property’s value, provided the lessee returns the property at the end of the lease period in accordance with Article 20A.

Article 17: Inspection and Repairs by the Landlord
The tenant must allow the landlord, at any reasonable time, to inspect the leased asset and carry out repairs in it, provided the landlord notifies the tenant a reasonable time in advance and minimizes interference with the tenant as much as possible.

CHAPTER 1, SECTION D: LEASE TERM

Article 18: Commencement of the Lease
The lease term begins upon delivery of the leased asset to the tenant.

Article 19: Termination of the Lease

(b) [Repealed.]

Article 20: Return of the Leased Asset at the End of the Lease Term
(a) At the end of the lease term, the tenant shall return the leased asset to the landlord, free of any person or property, except for the landlord’s property serving the leased asset.
(b) Once the tenant returns the leased asset as stated in subsection (a), the landlord shall accept it.
(c) If the leased asset is movable property, the tenant shall return it at the place where it was delivered to the tenant.

Article 20A: Return of a Leased Asset After Alterations
(a) If the tenant made alterations to the leased asset with the landlord’s consent, the tenant may choose between returning the leased asset as-is after the alterations or restoring it to its previous condition and returning it as it was before the alterations; if the tenant chooses to return it as-is, the tenant is not entitled to compensation for the alterations.
(b) If the tenant made alterations without the landlord’s consent, the following apply:
(1) If the landlord demands restoration, the tenant shall return the leased asset to the landlord as it was before the alterations; this does not derogate from the Unjust Enrichment Law, 1979;
(2) If the alteration was made to real estate and involved construction of fixtures as defined in Article 21 of the Land Law, the provisions of Chapter D of that Law apply.

CHAPTER 1, SECTION E: MISCELLANEOUS

Article 21: Tenant’s Rights Against Third Parties
(a) Once the lease right is granted to the tenant, it is effective against any person.
(b) The landlord may transfer the landlord’s right in the leased asset to another (the “purchaser”); if so, the purchaser replaces the landlord regarding the landlord’s rights and obligations under the lease contract and by law, even if the purchaser did not know of the lease contract.
(c) Any claim the tenant has against the landlord due to non-performance of obligations that applied to the landlord before completion of the transfer under subsection (b) shall also be valid against the purchaser.

Article 22: Assignment and Sublease
(a) The tenant may not assign to another the right to possess and use the leased asset, nor the tenant’s other obligations under the lease contract, and may not sublease the leased asset, except with the landlord’s consent. However, if the landlord withholds consent for unreasonable reasons or makes consent conditional on unreasonable terms, then:
(1) in a lease of real estate, the tenant may carry out the transaction without the landlord’s consent;
(2) in any lease, the court may authorize the transaction on terms it deems appropriate; and in a lease of real estate, the court may do so even contrary to the lease contract.
(b) Consent under subsection (a), for a lease of real estate, must be given in advance and in writing.

Article 23: General Remedies for Breach
